# FadeFrameUIParty - WOTLK 3.3.5
Lightweight addon that changes the transparency of the party frame based on the following conditions:    
- party member is lower than 80% health

This addon will hopefully make you more immersed in to the game and also prevent burn in on OLED-monitors. 

# This is 20% (default) transparency when party member is above 80% health.
